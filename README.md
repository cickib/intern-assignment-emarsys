## Holiday itinerary planner

Add destinations to a holiday instance, then get a planned route.

The route can be planned without any preference. If there's any preference regarding the order of destinations, before adding the destination to the holiday, set its next destination to the desired one so the algorithm can take it into account.

Preferred order and random destinations combined also work. Single destinations that have no next and no destination has them as their next always put at the end of the planned route.
